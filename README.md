LinCDE: Conditional Density Estimation via Lindsey's Method

Description:

Conditional density estimation is a fundamental problem in statistics, with various scientific and practical applications such as genetics and economics. We propose a conditional density estimator based on tree boosting and Lindsey's method (LinCDE). LinCDE admits flexible modeling of the density family and captures distributional characteristics like modality and shape. In particular, LinCDE always produces smooth and nonnegative density estimates. Furthermore, in the presence of nuisances, LinCDE identifies the influential covariates to the response distribution.
